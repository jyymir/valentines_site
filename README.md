# 💖 Our Journey: A 4-Year Anniversary Digital Experience

A custom-built, interactive web experience dedicated to someone, celebrating our journey from **June 22, 2023**, to the present. This project features a romantic timeline of memories, a dynamic photo gallery, and an interactive "Valentine Trap" entrance.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 💌 The "Valentine Trap" (Entrance)

- **Interactive Envelope:** A CSS-animated envelope that opens to reveal a heartfelt question.
- **The "No" Button Chase:** A playful JavaScript-powered button that runs away from the cursor/touch.
- **Dynamic "Yes" Growth:** The "Yes" button grows in size every time the "No" button is avoided, making the right choice inevitable.
- **Confetti & GIFs:** Celebratory animations and romantic GIFs trigger upon acceptance.

### ⏳ Living Timeline (Home)

- **Video-Centric Storytelling:** Autoplaying, muted, and looped video snippets of key dates (Zoo trips, Christmas, etc.).
- **Glassmorphism Navbar:** A modern, blurred navigation bar that remains sticky as you scroll through memories.
- **Mobile-Optimized Staggering:** A sophisticated CSS layout that staggers items on desktop but stacks them into a clean vertical line on mobile/iPad.
- **Scroll Progress Bar:** A visual indicator at the top of the page showing how far you’ve traveled through the story.

### 📸 Artistic Gallery

- **Masonry Layout:** A Pinterest-style grid that allows photos of different sizes to fit together perfectly without awkward gaps.
- **Days Counter:** A JavaScript counter that calculates exactly how many days have passed since **June 22, 2023**, complete with a pulsing heart animation.

### ✍️ Digital Letter

- **Parchment Aesthetic:** A responsive, "paper-style" container designed for intimate reading on any device.
- **Signature Styling:** Custom typography to give the letter a personal, handwritten feel.
